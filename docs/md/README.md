# my-flix-angular-client

### Brief Overview

This App is a reimagining of the [Apflix React Project](https://github.com/srpmfp/appflix-client) using Angular as a framework.

It leverages local storage for token, user, and movie data.

The movie data is example data and should not be thought of as accurate as it was generated in conjunction with AI. It functions as an API example project.
